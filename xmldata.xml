		<steps>
			(a) Calculate the volume of the cylinder.
			(b) Calculate the volume of remaining piece of metal after removing the cuboid.
		</steps>
	</question>

	<solution type='array'>

		<steps>Part (a):
			Radius of the cylinder	=	14/2
			=	7
			cm
			Volume of the cylinder
			=	πr2h
			=	22/7×7×7×25
			=	3850
			cm3</steps><steps>Part (b):
			Volume of the cuboid	=	6×6×25
			=	900
			cm3
			Volume of the remaining piece of metal
			=	Volume of cylinder −
			Volume of cuboid
			=	3850
			− 900
			=	2950
			cm3</steps>
